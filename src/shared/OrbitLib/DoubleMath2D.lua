    Calculates the vertex of a line-line intersection.

    @param lineAPosX (number)
    @param lineAPosY (number)
    @param lineAVectorX (number)
    @param lineAVectorY (number)
    @param lineBPosX (number)
    @param lineBPosY (number)
    @param lineBVectorX (number)
    @param lineBVectorY (number)

    @returns (number, number) The X and Y coordinate of the intersection
        between the two given lines. Will be NaN if parallel or coinciding.
    
    @attribution Shout out to our math consultant DarkFireDrago for coming
    up with this algorithm.
